# Search Google Books

Use Google Books API in a Meteor app.

A very simple app to exemplify how to get data from the Google Books API using 
http calls on the server side. It doesn't make use of the database. Once the 
data is received, it is "forwarded" to the client to be displayed. One can display
more data if desired, the example keeps it at a minimum. To see the complete data 
returned by the API, check this page: https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=wellesley.

A live instance can be found here: http://searchgbooks.meteor.com/.

This example was used in a programming class (Web Mashups).
